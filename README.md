This is a basic Movie project where I have implemented the Repository Pattern. I created a common UnitOfWork repository to consolidate all repositories into one. For design, I used Bootstrap, although the design is not perfect. I have also utilized ViewModels and integrated Identity. 
Users can register with their details, and when they create an account, they are assigned the 'Customer' role by default. An admin user can change roles using the UserManager.
